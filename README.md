# airline-passenger-satisfaction
## Problem Summary:
### 1.Objective: To predict whether a passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight experience, based on various features such as service quality, seat comfort, and on-time performance. The goal is to help airlines improve customer service and optimize operations.

### 2.Data:

* Passenger Demographics: Age, gender, travel class, type of travel (business or leisure).
* Flight-related Information: Flight distance, departure and arrival delays, in-flight services (food, entertainment).
* Survey Data: Passengers' ratings on various aspects such as seat comfort, cleanliness, staff behavior, and overall satisfaction.
### 3.Key Approaches:

* Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize/standardize the features.
* Feature Selection: Identify the most important factors influencing passenger satisfaction.
* Machine Learning Models: Use classification algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, or deep learning models to predict satisfaction levels.
### 4.Applications:

* Customer Service Improvement: Help airlines identify areas that need improvement, such as better seating, timely flights, or enhanced in-flight services.
* Personalized Services: Tailor services based on passenger preferences to increase satisfaction.
* Market Analysis: Understand customer trends and improve overall business strategy.
### 5.Challenges:

* Satisfaction is subjective and varies from passenger to passenger, making prediction complex.
* External factors like weather or airport services can influence satisfaction but may not be captured in the data.
* Balancing different customer needs (business vs. leisure travelers) can be challenging for airlines.
Airline Passenger Satisfaction is a key problem in the airline industry, with solutions helping companies enhance the overall travel experience and retain loyal customers.
